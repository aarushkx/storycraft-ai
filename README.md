# ðŸŽ¬ StoryCraftAI

A proof of concept AI-powered platform that transforms stories into captivating videos with AI-generated narration and visuals.

Turn your imagination into stunning videos! StoryCraftAI lets you create engaging story videos by either writing your own tales or generating them with AI, then bringing them to life with AI voices and beautiful background imagery.

## What StoryCraftAI Does

This creative tool makes video storytelling accessible to everyone:

1. **Story Creation** - Write your own story or let AI generate one based on your theme or prompt

2. **AI Narration** - Choose from various AI-generated voices to narrate your story

3. **Visual Magic** - Select AI-generated background images that match your story's mood

4. **Video Generation** - Watch as everything comes together into a polished video ready to share

## Models Used

-   **Audio Generation**: [Kokoro TTS](https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts)
-   **Subtitle Generation**: [Auto-Subtitle](https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-subtitle)
-   **Story Generation**: [Ollama with Llama2](https://ollama.com/library/llama2:7b)

## Getting Started

```

2. Set up Python environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Or on Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r ./backend/tools/requirements.txt
```

3. Install backend dependencies
