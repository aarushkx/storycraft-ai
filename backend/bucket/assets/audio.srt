1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
The village of Ravenswood was never the same after the night the stranger arrived.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,440
He was tall and imposing, with eyes that seemed to see right through you.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,680
He wore a long black coat, covered in blood stains, and carried a large, leather-bound

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,440
book under his arm.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,440
No one knew where he came from, but he appeared out of nowhere, as if summoned by some dark

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
force.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
He took up residence in the abandoned manor on the hill, surrounded by a forest that seemed

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,800
to grow more twisted and gnarled with each passing day.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,200
Rumors spread like wildfire through the village, each one more outlandish than the last.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,120
Some said he was a vampire, praying on the innocent at night.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,160
Others claimed he was a demon, summoned from the depths of hell to bring about the end

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
of days.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,960
But I knew the truth.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,880
I had seen him, standing in the shadows of my own garden, his eyes fixed on me with an

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,000
intensity that made my blood run cold.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,200
And I knew that he was not of this world, but rather a being from a realm beyond our

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,560
own.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,760
One night I decided to confront him.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,360
I crept up to the manor, my heart racing with fear and anticipation.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,600
As I approached, I heard the sound of laughter, low and menacing, coming from within.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
I steeled myself for what was to come and pushed open the creaking door.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,840
Suddenly the stranger was waiting for me, his eyes gleaming with amusement.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,680
And as I entered the room, a strange feeling came over me, like a shiver running down my

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
spine.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,960
It was then that I realized the truth.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,040
The stranger was not a vampire or a demon, but rather a lover come to claim my heart

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,560
and soul.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,360
And so it was that we embarked on a journey of love and horror, entwined in a tale of

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,400
mystery and intrigue.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,960
For though he was from beyond our world, the stranger was not a monster, but a being of

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,200
pure light come to bring me joy and happiness in a world filled with darkness and despair.
