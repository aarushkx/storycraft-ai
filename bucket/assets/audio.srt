1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Title, The Last Message.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,720
Alina still texted Leo every morning, even though he hadn't answered in weeks.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,960
It had started as a habit, asterisk, good morning, love, asterisk, but now it was more

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,360
like a prayer.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,320
She knew something was wrong, no one just disappears, not someone like Leo.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,040
They had loved fiercely, not the gentle, sitcom kind of love, no theirs had been wild, alive.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,160
They met in college, fought the world together, shared dreams, built a small life in a tiny

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,200
apartment filled with plants and laughter and vinyl records.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,720
Then Leo got the call for a journalism assignment in a conflict zone.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,080
He promised it was only for two weeks.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,040
He left her with a kiss and the same line he always said, I'll write you every day,

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,640
no matter what.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,160
And he did, until day 11.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,000
The silence was unbearable.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,560
Alina called the agency, no news.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,480
She contacted embassies, friends, strangers, weeks passed.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,520
Her texts turned from cheerful to desperate.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,960
Then one evening, a man knocked at her door.

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,920
His uniform said everything, his eyes even more.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,080
Leo had been taken by a militia group.

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
They tortured him for information.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,720
When they found his notebook, filled with names, photos, stories, they deemed him a

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
spy.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,440
They made a video, they made her watch.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,680
The camera didn't flinch, but she did.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,800
She screamed.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,320
He cried until no sound came out.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,320
They mailed her his watch, that stupid watch with the cracked face he refused to replace.

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,880
It still ticked.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,040
Alina didn't speak much after that.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,760
She still texted him every morning.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,400
Until one day, she left her phone beside the watch on the table and walked into the ocean.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,120
No goodbyes.

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,280
Just a message on the lock screen.

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,480
I miss you, even where there are no words left.
